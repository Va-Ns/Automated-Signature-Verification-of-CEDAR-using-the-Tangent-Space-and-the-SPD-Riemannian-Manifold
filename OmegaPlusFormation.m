            % From theory we know that the logarithmic mapping corresponds to the subtraction
            % between two points. The first point is the basis and the next point is the one that is
            % raised to the tangent space (see Pennec et al. "A Riemannian Framework for Tensor
            % Computing"). 
            % 
            % We also know that the logarithmic mapping is given by:
            %                         
            %                          X^(1/2) * log( X^(-1/2)*Y*X^(-1/2) ) * X^(1/2)
            %
            % From [Tuzel et al]: "Pedestrian Detection via Classificationon Riemannian Manifolds"
            % we get that the orthonormal coordinates of a tangent vector y in the tangent space at
            % point X is given by the vector operator
            %
            %                           vec_X(y) = vec_I( X^(-1/2)*y*X^(-1//2) )
            %
            % So, given that y is the result of the logarithmic mapping, we can write that:
            %
            % vec_X(y) = vec_I( X^(-1/2)*(X^(1/2)*log( X^(-1/2)*Y*X^(-1/2) )*X^(1/2))*X^(-1//2))
            %
            %                        vec_X(y) = vec_I( log ( X^(-1/2)*Y*X^(-1/2) ) )
            %
            % So if we use the norm on the vec_X(y) we basically get the Affine Invariant Riemannian
            % Metric (AIRM)
            %
            % Then, since the result is a symmetric and not always positive definite matrix, in
            % order to create the vector representation of this matrix, we take the main diagonal
            % and multiply it's lower (or upper triangular- per user preference) with sqrt(2) to
            % negate the effects of the norm
